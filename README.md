# Fossil-Fighters-Demo-Extractor
This tool extracts the files out of the FF1 and FFC Kiosk demos (the tiny ~2MB ones; the bigger ones already have normal files). It then runs them through fftool, so you get PNGs and whatnot. You should also be
able to run the resulting out.nds through Carbonizer to get the text.
